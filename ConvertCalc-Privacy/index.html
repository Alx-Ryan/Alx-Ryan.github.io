<h1>Privacy Policy – ConvertCalc</h1>

<p>
  ConvertCalc respects your privacy. We keep personal data collection to a minimum
  and use third-party services only where necessary.
</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Calculations run on your device. Your calculation history and custom themes are stored locally.
  </li>
  <li>
    We fetch currency exchange rates over the internet from the Frankfurter API to keep conversions current.
    This request includes your IP address as part of normal network traffic.
  </li>
  <li>
    We show non-personalized ads via Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). We request that ads are not tailored using
    your personal data. The ad network may still receive basic device and usage information needed to serve
    and measure ads.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you upgrade to the paid version, ads are removed and we stop requesting ads from AdMob,
    so no ad network data is sent after you upgrade.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The app does not request access to your location, contacts, or photos.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>
  If you have any questions about this policy, please contact support.
